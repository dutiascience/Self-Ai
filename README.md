# Self-Ai
SelfAi is an AI web-based chatbot built on a pre-trained transformer majorly used for Natural
Language Processing. The chatbot acts as an empathetic conversational agent to deliver
cognitive behavioural therapy for patients during mental health crises. This system will adapt
the transfer learning approach, which is a machine learning method where a model developed
for a task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task. The transformer used, Dialo-GPT
is fine-tuned on the CounselChat dataset.
